# The Cycle Of Life Game

The Cycle Of Life Game is a game created in the style of rock, paper, scissors. There are three options for the player to select - Human, Plant and Soil. The aim of the game is to select as many correct options as possible to beat the computer. A total of seven attempts are allowed before the game ends and decides the winner. The rules of the game are included on the index page and as well as winning or losing a player can also tie with the computer.

## Features

### **Header**

The header shows the name of the game and provides information on how to win the game.

### **Game Area**

The game area shows the score of the player and the computer and underneath that area is the game selection area where a player can select either Human, Plant or Soil. Instructions are provided on how to start the game so the player understands that the game only starts once they have made their first selection.

Once a selection has been made the player is informed of the result and the selection the computer made.

## **Testing**

- The website has been tested to work in different browers including Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

- The @media code has been added and tested to ensure the game keeps its structure at the lowest screen size of 320 x 480 px.

- The link from the game to the winner and loser pages has been tested along with the buttons on each page to ensure they go to the correct place.

- All links to external pages in the social media footer have been checked.

- I tested that all parts of the game work including the score area and game selection area plus the additonal webpages and their buttons.

- I tested that the instructions were easy to understand.

## **Validator Testing**

**_Javascript_**

The Javascript was run through JS Hint Javascript Validator - https://jshint.com/
Two unused variables were detected and removed.

**_HTML_**
The HTML code was run through W3C Validator and found duplicate IDs for game images, id="imgChoice" on line 34 of index page. This was updated to include imgChoice1 and imgChoice2 plus the CSS file was updated to include the same image size instructions. There were also a couple of stray end divs to remove.
Once completed no other errors were found when the code was entered into the validator

## **Technologies Used**

The technologies used to create this game include

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Codeanywhere
- GitHub
- Canva to create images
- Font Awesome

## **Unfixed Bugs**

No unfixed bugs to report.

## **Additional Features**

When there is more time I would like to add additional features to the human, plant, soil options so there are at least five different options to choose from rather than three.

## **Deployment**

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the repositories on the right and click on the relevant one to open up the project.
- Go to Settings tab and then down to the tab called Pages.
- From the source section drop-down menu, select "Deploy from a branch".
- Directly under is Branch. Select "main" and "root" then click on save.
- A few minutes later GitHub will provide a link to the live site which indicates successful deployment.
